# PasswordGenerator
This is just a password generator I created in Excel because I get bored. 
 It is a simple excel document with a few formulas to make a series of passwords of varying lengths to pick from. It uses the words in the dictionary with spaces and other types of special characters with numbers. 

 All the places say the passwords are plenty secure, so feel free to use it if you like.
